<I>Favorite Philly Foods</I> <br/>

Federal Donuts (get a hot fresh donut, feel the world fade away, cry when it all comes back with your last bite, dry your tears, and get in line for another) <br/>
Trattoria Carina (get the crab pasta and don't share)<br/>
Noord (get extra bread, the bread pudding, and extra bread) ‚Äî RIP<br/>
Perla (get the fried pompano, pinakbet, lumpia, and pandesal and look forward to leftovers)<br/>
Pho 75 (get pho'd up)<br/>
Nam Son (get the best banh mi of your life) ‚Äî RIP, see sister restaurant Hello Vietnam<br/>
Talula's Garden (get dinner, not brunch, and don't skip the biscuits)<br/>
The Bakeshop on 20th (get a turkey bacon, egg, and cheese on a philly muffin and a chocolate chip cookie on weekday mornings when you can't believe it's not Friday)<br/>
Kalaya (get everything everyone is talking about on yelp even though you have no spice tolerance, take two hours to finish the food, crying and sweating through every bite and throwing a small fit every time your water cup nears empty, quickly say bye to your friends with a mouth so numb you can't feel your snot running into it, and spend the rest of the day feeling exhausted. From then on, get the turmeric monkfish and cabbage, which are tasty and not spicy)<br/>
K'far (get a Jerusalem bagel sandwich or one of their salads when you don't mind waiting an hour for a quick lunch..)<br/>
E Mei (get the qongqing chicken, fish fillet with green peppercorn but don't drink the soup unless you want to set your mouth on fire, cumin lamb, shrimp salty egg yolk tofu, pea shoots, eggplant, and green beans)<br/>
Nam Phuong (get the bo luc lac and anything else)<br/>
Goldie (get one of everything and eat it all yourself since it's vegan so it must be healthy‚Äîright, right, right???)<br/>
Middle Child (get a BLT when heirloom tomatoes are at their peak in the summer and attain nirvana)<br/>
John's Water Ice (get any ice flavor but cherry)<br/>
Hello Vietnam (get the tofu banh mi, trust me on this)<br/>
