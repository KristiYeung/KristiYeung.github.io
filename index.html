<I>What to get at my favorite Philly food places</I> <br/>

<a href=https://www.federaldonuts.com/ target="_blank">Federal Donuts</a> (get a hot fresh donut, feel the world fade away, cry when your last bite brings it all back, dry your tears, and get in line for another) <br/>
<a href=https://www.trattoriacarina.com/ target="_blank">Trattoria Carina</a> (get the spicy crab pasta and don't share)<br/>
<a href=https://noordphilly.com/ target="_blank">Noord</a> (get bread, the bread pudding, and extra bread) — RIP<br/>
<a href=http://www.perlaphilly.com/ target="_blank">Perla</a> (get the fried pompano, pinkabet, lumpia, and pandesal and look forward to leftovers)<br/>
<a href=http://phoseventyfive.com/ target="_blank">Pho 75</a> (get pho'd up)<br/>
<a href=https://whyy.org/articles/hoa-binh-plaza-banh-mi-shop-closed-amid-concerns-that-city-agency-was-weaponized-for-gentrification/ target="_blank">Nam Son</a> (get the best banh mi of your life) — RIP, see sister restaurant Hello Vietnam<br/>
<a href=https://talulasgarden.com/ target="_blank">Talula's Garden</a> (get the biscuits and anything else for dinner, skip their brunch)<br/>
<a href=https://www.bakeshopon20th.com/ target="_blank">The Bakeshop on 20th</a> (get a turkey bacon, egg, and cheese on a philly muffin and a chocolate chip cookie on weekday mornings when you can't believe it's not Friday)<br/>
<a href=https://www.kalaya.net/kalaya-thai-kitchen target="_blank">Kalaya</a> (get everything everyone is talking about on yelp even though you have no spice tolerance, take two hours to finish the food, crying and sweating through every bite and throwing a small fit every time your water cup nears empty, quickly say bye to your friends with a mouth so numb you can't feel your snot running into it, and spend the rest of the day exhausted because eating food that spicy is an *experience*. From then on, get the turmeric monkfish and cabbage, which are tasty but not painfully so)<br/>
<a href=https://www.kfarcafe.com/ target="_blank">K'far</a> (get a Jerusalem bagel sandwich or one of their salads when you don't mind waiting an hour for a quick lunch..)<br/>
<a href=https://www.emeiphilly.com/ target="_blank">E Mei</a> (get the qongqing chicken, fish fillet with green peppercorn, cumin lamb, shrimp salty egg yolk tofu, pea shoots, eggplant, and green beans)<br/>
<a href=https://www.namphuongphilly.com/home target="_blank">Nam Phuong</a> (get the bo luc lac, watercress, and bun)<br/>
<a href=https://www.goldiefalafel.com/ target="_blank">Goldie</a> (get one of everything and eat it all yourself since it's vegan so it must be healthy—right, right, right???)<br/>
<a href=https://middlechildphilly.com/ target="_blank">Middle Child</a> (get a BLT when heirloom tomatoes are at their peak in the summer and attain nirvana)<br/>
<a href=https://middlechildphilly.com/clubhouse/visit/ target="_blank">Middle Child Clubhouse</a> (get the vegan sandwich, not the burger, unless you want to spend the evening attempting to persuade your dining companion, who made the better decision, to trade)<br/>
<a href=https://johnswaterice.com/ target="_blank">John's Water Ice</a> (get any ice flavor but cherry and bring cash)<br/>
<a href=https://www.hellovietnamasianbistro.com/ target="_blank">Hello Vietnam</a> (get the tofu banh mi...you're like—no, seriously, tofu? and I'm like—yes, seriously, tofu!)<br/>
